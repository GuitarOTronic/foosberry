    "readme": "# babel-preset-react-app\n\nThis package includes the Babel preset used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>\nPlease refer to its documentation:\n\n- [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) – How to create a new app.\n- [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.\n\n## Usage in Create React App Projects\n\nThe easiest way to use this configuration is with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which includes it by default. **You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**\n\n## Usage Outside of Create React App\n\nIf you want to use this Babel preset in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with the following steps.\n\nFirst, [install Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/).\n\nThen install babel-preset-react-app.\n\n```sh\nnpm install babel-preset-react-app --save-dev\n```\n\nThen create a file named `.babelrc` with following contents in the root folder of your project:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"react-app\"]\n}\n```\n\nThis preset uses the `useBuiltIns` option with [transform-object-rest-spread](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/) and [transform-react-jsx](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-jsx/), which assumes that `Object.assign` is available or polyfilled.\n\n## Usage with Flow\n\nMake sure you have a `.flowconfig` file at the root directory. You can also use the `flow` option on `.babelrc`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [[\"react-app\", { \"flow\": true, \"typescript\": false }]]\n}\n```\n\n## Usage with TypeScript\n\nMake sure you have a `tsconfig.json` file at the root directory. You can also use the `typescript` option on `.babelrc`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [[\"react-app\", { \"flow\": false, \"typescript\": true }]]\n}\n```\n",
